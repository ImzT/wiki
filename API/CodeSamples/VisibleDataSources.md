#VisibleDataSources

[[_TOC_]]

##About
**Data Type:** string[]  
**Accepted Values:** Table, view and stored procedure names   
**Default value:** Empty array  
**Impacted Features:** Report Design, Report List  
**Purpose:** Gets or sets the array of names for tables views, and stored procedures that should be shown in Data Sources tab of the Report Designer and Instant Reports.  
**Usage:** This setting is used to make specific tables, views, and stored procedures appear in Izenda. Without this setting Izenda will present all tables and views by default. It is also used to limit what data sources each user has access to for security reasons.  
**Caveats:** Setting any values in this list will completely override the normally constructed list of tables and views on a per-user basis. Additionally, any reports that use a data source that is hidden from the current user will not be available for a user to access.  

##Code Samples
###Global.asax (Câ™¯)

```csharp
//main class: inherits DatabaseAdHocConfig or FileSystemAdHocConfig
public class CustomAdHocConfig : Izenda.AdHoc.DatabaseAdHocConfig
{
  // Configure settings
  // Add custom settings after setting the license key and connection string by overriding the ConfigureSettings() method
  public static void InitializeReporting() {
    //Check to see if we've already initialized.
    if (HttpContext.Current.Session == null || HttpContext.Current.Session["ReportingInitialized"] != null)
      return;
    AdHocSettings.LicenseKey = "INSERT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE";
    //Creates a connection to Microsoft SQL Server
    AdHocSettings.SqlServerConnectionString = "INSERT_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE";
    Izenda.AdHoc.AdHocSettings.AdHocConfig = new CustomAdHocConfig();
    AdHocSettings.VisibleDataSources = new string[] {"Table1", "Table2", "View1", "StoredProcedure1"}; //The relevant setting
    HttpContext.Current.Session["ReportingInitialized"] = true;
  }
}
```

###Global.asax (VB.NET)

```visualbasic
'main class: inherits DatabaseAdHocConfig or FileSystemAdHocConfig
Public Class CustomAdHocConfig
    Inherits Izenda.AdHoc.DatabaseAdHocConfig

    Shared Sub InitializeReporting()
        'Check to see if we've already initialized
        If HttpContext.Current.Session Is Nothing OrElse HttpContext.Current.Session("ReportingInitialized") IsNot Nothing Then
            Return
        'Initialize System
        AdHocSettings.LicenseKey = "INSERT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"
        AdHocSettings.SqlServerConnectionString = "INSERT_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"
        Izenda.AdHoc.AdHocSettings.AdHocConfig = New CustomAdHocConfig()
        AdHocSettings.VisibleDataSources = New String() {"Table1", "Table2", "View1", "StoredProcedure1"} 'The relevant setting
        HttpContext.Current.Session("ReortingInitialized") = True
    End Sub
End Class
```

##Alternate Usage: All Tables, Views and Stored Procedures Visible 

If you would like for all tables, views and stored procedures to be shown you can use the following schema query to populate the visible datasources. 

**IMPORTANT!**
**Stored Procedures that are not used for reporting must be limited using the where clause in this query. Stored Procedures are run when loading the data source list, so any that are used to drop tables, delete records, etc. should not be included. This will execute all Stored Procedures allowed with NULL parameters. This should be used only for trialing and testing purposes.**
  
**Note:** On initial loading of Izenda with this method, this could take moment to load depending on the number of data sources being loaded. It may give the appearance that the page is stalling. Please wait a few minutes to allow all data sources to be loaded and stored procedures to be run.  Alternatively, set [[AdHocSettings.LazySpMetadataPulling|http://wiki.izenda.us/API/CodeSamples/LazySpMetadataPulling]] equal to true, forcing Izenda to only run stored procedures if and when they are selected as a data source.
```csharp
<%@ Import Namespace="System.Data" %>

//setting vis datasources
DataSet ds = AdHocContext.Driver.GetDataSet(AdHocContext.Driver.CreateCommand("select * from sys.objects where type in ('U','P','V')"));
string[] results = new string[ds.Tables[0].Rows.Count];
for (int i = 0; i < ds.Tables[0].Rows.Count; i++)
results[i] = ds.Tables[0].Rows[i][0].ToString();
AdHocSettings.VisibleDataSources = results;
```
