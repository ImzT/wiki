**Summary:**  If true, the axes will scale to the remaining visible series once one series is hidden. If false, hiding and showing a series will not affect the axes or the other series. For stacks, once one series within the stack is hidden, the rest of the stack will close in around it even if the axis is not affected. Default: true
