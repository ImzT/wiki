#CanvasToolsURL

[[_TOC_]]

##About

**Summary:**  The URL to the additional file to lazy load for Android 2.x devices. These devices don't support SVG, so we download a helper file that contains <a href="http://code.google.com/p/canvg/">canvg</a>, its dependecy rbcolor, and our own CanVG Renderer class. To avoid hotlinking to our site, you can install canvas-tools.js on your own server and change this option accordingly. Default: http://code.highcharts.com/{version}/modules/canvas-tools.js
