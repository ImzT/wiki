##About

**Summary:**  Fires when the mouse leaves the graph. The <code>this</code> keyword refers to the series object itself. One parameter, <code>event</code>, is passed to the function. This contains common event information based on jQuery or MooTools depending on which library is used as the base for Highcharts. If the <a class="internal" href="#plotOptions-series">stickyTracking</a> option is true, <code>mouseOut</code> doesn't happen before the mouse enters another graph or leaves the plot area.
