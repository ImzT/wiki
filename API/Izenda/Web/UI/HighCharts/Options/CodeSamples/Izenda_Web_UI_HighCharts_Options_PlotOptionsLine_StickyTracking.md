#StickyTracking

[[_TOC_]]

##About

**Summary:**  Sticky tracking of mouse events. When true, the <code>mouseOut</code> event on a series isn't triggered until the mouse moves over another series, or out of the plot area. When false, the <code>mouseOut</code> event on a series is triggered when the mouse leaves the area around the series' graph or markers. This also implies the tooltip. When <code>stickyTracking</code> is false and <code>tooltip.shared</code> is false, the tooltip will be hidden when moving the mouse between series. Default: true
