#MinRange

[[_TOC_]]

##About

**Summary:** <p>The minimum range to display on this axis. The entire axis will not be allowed to span over a smaller interval than this. For example, for a datetime axis the main unit is milliseconds. If minRange is set to 3600000, you can't zoom in more than to one hour.</p><p>The default minRange for the x axis is five times the smallest interval between any of the data points.</p><p>On a logarithmic axis, the unit for the minimum range is the power. So a minRange of 1 means that the axis can be zoomed to 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10000 etc.</p>
