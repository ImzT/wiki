#How do I control the alignment of text fields or justification in report output?

[[_TOC_]]

##Controlling Alignment

The justification or alignment can be controlled through the Izenda Reports 5.4  settings.aspx page by setting the "Show Justification" setting on the "Features " tab.   The justification of right, left, and center will then be editable in the report designer by clicking into the "Fields" tab and looking for the "J" checkbox column. Click in a checkbox to select "L", "M", "R" (left, middle, right) respectively.
