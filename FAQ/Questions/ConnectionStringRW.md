#ConnectionStringRW
[[_TOC_]]


##About

ConnectionStringRW is one of Izenda Driver's properties, which enables users to have Read-Write access permission to Database


Below is a sample global.asax using the ConnectionStringRW setting. The code block will appear within <script runat="server"> </script> tags within global.asax

##Global.asax (Câ™¯)
```csharp

 public class CustomAdHocConfig : FileSystemAdHocConfig {
    public static void InitializeReporting() {
      //Check to see if we've already initialized.
      if (HttpContext.Current.Session == null || HttpContext.Current.Session["ReportingInitialized"] != null)
        return;
      //Initialize System
      AdHocSettings.LicenseKey = "INSERT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE";
      AdHocSettings.SqlServerConnectionString = "INSERT_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE";
      AdHocContext.Driver.ConnectionStringRW = "INSERT_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE";   // ConnectionStringRW was used
      ...
      }
}
```

##Global.asax (VB.NET)

```visualbasic

'main class: inherits DatabaseAdHocConfig or FileSystemAdHocConfig
Public Class CustomAdHocConfig
    Inherits Izenda.AdHoc.DatabaseAdHocConfig

    Shared Sub InitializeReporting()
        'Check to see if we've already initialized
        If HttpContext.Current.Session Is Nothing OrElse HttpContext.Current.Session("ReportingInitialized") IsNot Nothing Then
            Return
        'Initialize System
        AdHocSettings.LicenseKey = "INSERT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"
        AdHocSettings.SqlServerConnectionString = "INSERT_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"
        AdHocContext.Driver.ConnectionStringRW = "INSERT_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"


    End Sub

End Class
```


##How ConnectionStringRW works

1) If ConnectionStringRW is not assigned, Izenda uses Driver.ConnectionString for all operations against DB

2) If ConnectionStringRW is also assigned, then Izenda will

  a) Use Driver.ConnectionString for Read-Only operations against DB, thus Driver.ConnectionString can have ReadOnly access to the DB

  b) Use Driver.ConnectionStringRW for Read-Write operations. At this moment this includes only following:

    - Create Reports table if it doesn't exist

    - Create/Update/Delete Thumbnails in Reports table in Database mode

    - Create/Update/Delete Forms in Reports table in Database mode

    - Create/Save/Delete ReportSets in Reports table in Database mode

[Here](http://www.screencast.com/users/IzendaReports/folders/Temporary/media/a04a117c-89d1-40f3-8053-55d0d7586d1a) is video demonstrating how installation works when Driver.ConnectionStringRW is assigned for read-write operations, and Driver.ConnectionString has ReadOnly access: 

##Usage
ConnectionStringRW can be used always. General case is just safety improvement - if user specifies ConnectionStringRW, and uses read-only DB account for usual Driver.ConnectionString - he can be 100% sure that users will not be able to modify anything in DB by any means - like using SQL injections. Just because everything which user can input - goes to DB via read-only connection string.
