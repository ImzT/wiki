#Toggle Text Wrapping on the Report List

##Instructions

On the report list, you can toggle the wrapping for the report titles. To accomplish this, modify the main.css file. Find the string "word-break:" under the "#tabs .thumbs div.thumb-title" CSS rule and replace the word that follows with either "break-all" to text wrap or "normal" to disable text wrapping.
