#6.0 Summary Tab

[[_TOC_]]

##About

In the Summary tab (shown below), a table can be created that summarizes the chosen fields using different functions (Ex: Average, Count, Maximum, and so on). You can also make a group of fields by choosing the Group option from the Function dropdown menu.

Most actions and properties available in the Summary Tab are available in the Fields Tab. 
The only difference is the removal of the Quick Add and Pivot capabilities, and addition of the **Add Deltas** checkbox

For more information on performing a Summary, refer to the [[Fields section|/Guides/ReportDesign/3.0-fields-tab]]. 

##6.1 Deltas

The word delta means "a change in".  
Any time there is a change in a quantity, that change is calculated by taking the latter value of that quantity and subtracting from it the prior value of that quantity.

This can be used in a summary report by checking "Add Deltas" checkbox.
