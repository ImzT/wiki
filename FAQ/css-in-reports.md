#What CSS Will Be Included In My Report?

When creating a report and exporting or using the report through Izenda ReportParts, this is the relevant CSS:

- Report CSS ``AdHocSettings.ReportCssUrl``
- Field-Value CSS ``AdHocSettings.FieldValueCssUrl`` _We include this when field-value style is applied._
- Embedded CSS in the Style tab.
