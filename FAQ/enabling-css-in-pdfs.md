#Enabling CSS in PDFs & PDF Exports

PDFs generated by our legacy **ITextSharp** PDF generator do not support CSS and many other things such as 'Landscape' printing. 

In version 6.9 PDF output is handled with the setting [[PdfPrintMode|/API/CodeSamples/PrintMode]].

In legacy versions 6.8 and below PDF output is handled with the setting [[PrintMode|/API/CodeSamples/PrintMode]].
