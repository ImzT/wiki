#Forking The Resources Repository

[[_TOC_]]

##About

The resources repository is where the HTML, CSS, and javascript reside within the Izenda application. This repository is a public repository to allow customers to be able to modify the resources on an as-needed basis. In order to keep up with changes we make to the resources, it is prudent to fork the repository to keep up with all the updates while maintaining any customizations you might create on your own.

##How to fork

<script type="text/javascript">
alert("hello");
</script>
