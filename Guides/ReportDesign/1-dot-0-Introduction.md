#1.0 Introduction to Izenda Reports

[[_TOC_]]

##About

Izenda Reports contains several different reporting pages within the downloadable demo site that can either be used as-is or modified to fit your organization's needs. In this section, we will give you a quick overview of all the different pages that Izenda offers to outline the various reporting features and possibilities for integrating Izenda.

##1.1 Report List

The Report List page comes packaged with the downloadable demo and is already configured to leverage the responsive AJAX API that will communicate with the Izenda Reports DLL. This page can work standalone or be plugged directly into any container in a master page. From here, you may view reports or edit them. The toolbar is part of the Izenda site's master page and is designed to work across all reporting pages out of the box. You can implement your own header as well. Below is an example of a Report List page that has been branded and styled to give a Microsoft Office 2013 feel.
