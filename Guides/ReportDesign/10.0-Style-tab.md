#10.0 Style Tab

[[_TOC_]]

##About

The style tab is where you can customize the look and feel of your report. You can also change the color of the border, header, and rows, as well as the order of the report items. We will go over the controls in detail here and how you can use them to maximize the effectiveness of your reports.

![The Style Tab](http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/10-dot-0-Style-tab/style_tab.png)

##10.1 Style Properties

There are six separate controls that you can use to select the colors used for various elements on your report. You can see the results of your changes in the sample grid that is displayed directly below the dropdown menus. The colors that can be changed are: Border color, Header color, Header foreground color, Item color, Item foreground color, and Alternating item color.

Explanations of these features are given below:

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|:---------:|:-------------:|
|Border Color|Affects the color of the border surrounding your grid cells|
|Header Color|Affects the background color of the report header columns. If you use [[visual grouping|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/4.0-fields-tab#4.3-Sort,-VG,-&-Arithmetic-Check-Boxes]], this affects all header columns in each visual group.|
|Header Foreground Color|Affects the text color of every header column in your report.|
|Item Color|Affects the background color of the odd numbered report items.|
|Item Foreground Color|Affects the text color of all report items.|
|Alternating Item Color|Affects the background color of the even numbered report items.|
|Restore Default|Reverts all of the previously mentioned controls' settings back to their defaults.|

##10.2 CSS & Printing Controls

These controls will allow you to control the style of your reports on a granular scale if need be and also to apply various visual elements to printed reports. 

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|:---------:|:-------------:|
|CSS|You can define any custom CSS to be used on this report inside the text box. You can use the browser object inspector to discern CSS class names used on the grid so you can override them.|
|Landscape Printing|When checked, this will cause reports printed from the report viewer to be printed in landscape mode. Otherwise they will be printed in portrait mode.|
|Show Page Number|When checked, this will display the page number on all page-dependent printed reports. This will not apply to the report viewer or to XML, XLS, and CSV exports.|
|Show Date and Time|When checked, this will display the date and time on all page-dependent printed reports. This will not apply to the report viewer or to XML, XLS, and CSV exports.|
|Use Pagination in Web View|Sets whether the report viewer will use paging.|
|Add Bookmark for Each Visual Group|Sets whether bookmarks will be used on each visual group. Applies only to PDF exports.|
|Page Break After Visual Groups|Sets whether each visual group will receive its own page when exported. This will not apply to XML, XLS, or CSV exports. 'Page Break After Visual Groups' is not the same as 'Page Break After Field' in the Advanced Field Settings of FIELDS tab.     |

##10.3 Report Viewer Styling

These controls will allow you to control the visual flow of the elements in your report as they appear on the report viewer.

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|:---------:|:-------------:|
|Minimize Grid Width|Adjusts the margins of the data grid to match the size of the data. This can result in columns that are not uniform size.|
|Visual Group Style|Sets how visual groupings will be displayed. This is described in detail below.|
|Items Per Page|Allows a user to set the number of items shown per page in the report viewer.|
|Report Order|Allows the user to set the order of items included in the report (Summary, Chart, Gauge, Map, Detail). The detail grid is the one created on the Fields tab. If you cannot position an item between two charts, check [[here|/FAQ/Why-Are-My-Charts-Stuck-Together]].
|Field&#124;Value Column Pairs|Allows the user to set the field value style for multiple columns displaying on one row. [[See an example|http://www.izenda.com/bi/ReportDesigner.aspx?rn=Accounting]].|
|Show Main Report in Field&#124;Value Style|Allows a user to set whether the entire detail grid will be shown using the field value style defined above.|
|Show Summary Report in Field&#124;Value Style|Allows a user to set whether the summary grid uses the field value style defined above.|

##10.4 Changing Colors Through CSS

Izenda Reports fully integrates with your application both at the program level and visually. All visual aspects of Izenda Reports are user customizable and can be made to match your existing application's visual look and feel. Listed below are some of the quickest ways to change the look and feel of our application in order to blend seamlessly with your product or application.

You can get a complete overview of the process for using custom CSS styles on the report designer from [[this tutorial|http://wiki.izenda.us/FAQ/Questions/Overriding-page-level-css#Report-Designer]].

###10.4.1 Customer Integration Example

Here is an example of one solution that used customized CSS in order to more fully integrate Izenda into the hosting application.

##10.5 Visual Group Styles

Using visual groups, you can change how reports display grouped data. There are a number of different options to choose from. We will provide an example of each of them and an in-depth look at the last two.

| **Type** | **Appearanace** |
|:--------:|:---------------:|
|Comma Delimited|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_comma_delimited.png)|
|Comma Delimited With Labels|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_comma_delimited_w_labels.png)|
|Line Delimited|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_line_delimited.png)|
|Line Delimited With Labels|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_line_delimited_w_labels.png)|
|Field&#124;Value|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_field_value.png)|
|Multi Level|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_multi_level.png)|
|Multi Level With Labels|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_multi_level_w_labels.png)|
|Analysis Grid|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_analysis_grid.png)|
|VG Hierarchy|![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_vg_hierarchy.png)|

As you can see, most of the styles you can choose from will put the VG grouped fields at the top of the report and the non-grouped fields will then be displayed in a normal grid. The bottom two options are the exception to this and provide users with more control over what data they are viewing by allowing them to click on the (+)/(-) symbols. This will expand or collapse the container for each level of data.

###Analysis Grid

The analysis grid VG style will initially start with every expandable row collapsed. When you click on the (+) next to the value, it will expand that section of the analysis grid and display the data inside. You can have multiple levels nested inside each container and Izenda will automatically calculate the totals for numeric fields inside the non-visual-grouped fields. Below is an example of a 5-level analysis grid.

![](/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab/vg_analysis_grid_expanded_2.png)

The white area contains all the columns that were not checked as "VG" in the report designer. Here, the columns were the count of the orders for that visual group, how many total units are on the order, and the unit price of each item. You can modify the behavior of the VG aggregate functions on the [[Advanced box|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/4.0-fields-tab#4.8-Advanced-Field-Settings-Button]] of the fields tab by changing the **subtotal function**.

*Note*: Analysis Grid has some requirements.
1. You must have at least two fields selected as Visual Groups - Analysis Grid constructs a hierarchy, and you cannot have a hierarchy of one.
2. You must have at least one field selected as an aggregate. Once a hierarchy has been built, the grid must have something to display.
3. Best practice is for all of the visually grouped fields to be placed at the top of the field order stack.

Please see [[this page|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/16.0-Analysis-Grid]] for more information. 

###VG Hierarchy

The VG hierarchy style will create a flat hierarchical representation of the data using the visual group fields as containers. But instead of displaying each level of the hierarchy below the container field's value, it displays it to the right. It also displays all levels expanded by default instead of collapsed by default. You can expand or collapse containers like with the analysis grid.

If you attempt to expand a level without also expanding the one before it, nothing will happen. But if you then click the level before it, then all the data within the child level will be expanded as well. If you click the parent level first, then all the child levels will retain the expanded/collapsed state they had when you closed the parent level.  Below is an example of the VG hierarchy.
