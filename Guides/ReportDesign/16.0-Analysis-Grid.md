Analysis Grid is a hierarchical visual group display option. Like all visual groups, it permits more than one field to be toggled as a visual group. However, instead of displaying each visual group as a combination of the values drawn from selected fields, Analysis Grid displays a collapsible hierarchy with dynamic subtotaling on every level.

In this example, we are using the Orders table from the Northwinds database. We have selected ShipCountry, ShipRegion, and ShipCity as our Visual Group fields.  In the Style tab, we have also changed the Visual Group Style to Analysis Grid. This is our result:

The first thing to note here is that at the top, there is a pseudovalue labeled All. This value is a built in grand total, and represents the aggregate of Count(Order ID) and Sum(Freight) for all given values of ShipCountry, ShipRegion, and ShipCity. Note also the collapse buttons – the All value is expanded, and the highest level categories are all collapsed. We can click on these buttons to expand that category, and get more detail about the subordinate levels of data.

In the above example, we have fully expanded the tree for both Argentina and Brazil. First, note that there is no Ship Region value for Argentina. This value is blank, but we can still expand it anyway.  Also, note that the country Argentina, the blank region, and city Buenos Aires have the same values to the right for Order ID and Freight. This is because in this data, Buenos Aires is the only city in blank region, which in turn is the only region in Argentina. The same is true with Rio de Janeiro in the RJ region of Brazil. 

One final thing to note is that the data structure from left to right of City, Region, State is established in the report designer. Any fields flagged as Visual Group fields in the designer will be read top-to-bottom and displayed left-to-right in the viewer. If we had the fields City, Region, Country in top down order, then the leftmost column here would be city – which would have limited functionality using this VG style. Izenda will not automatically establish the proper data hierarchy, so it is important for the user to understand the data and how fields relate to one another to prevent top-down information from being displayed bottom-up.
