#2.0 Quick Start Guide

[[_TOC_]]

##About

The following section will demonstrate the basic capabilities of the Report Designer and how to create both simple and advanced reports. 

##2.1 Building your first report

Before we begin creating a new report, you can visit our [[demo site|http://www.izenda.com/bi/ReportList.aspx]] to begin following along. Once you have done that, come back to this guide and follow the additional steps. Alternately, you can watch the video below to begin creating your first report (redirects to youtube).

To begin creating a new report, simply click the "+New" button on the Report List. You will then select "Report" from the menu that appears. You will be directed to the Report Designer.

Here, you will see that you have landed on the [[Data Sources tab|/Guides/ReportDesign/3.0-Data-sources-tab]]. More information is available by clicking the link. For now, select **Orders**. Then click "Continue to Fields".

Now that you are on the [[Fields tab|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/4.0-fields-tab]], select the fields **ShipCountry**, **ShipCity**, and **Freight** in the dropdowns on the page. This will add the fields to your report. Notice that when you select a field, a new set of controls appears below to allow additional selections. This and other features are covered more in Section 3, referenced above.

You're almost done with your first report. You may now click **Preview** to see what your report will look like to anyone who views it.

You can now click **Save As...** on the toolbar to save your new report. You must enter a name for your report, but the category is optional. If you opt not to select a category, the report will be **Uncategorized**.

You now have your first functional report. This is a very basic example, and Izenda Reports offers many more capabilities, described throughout this guide.

##2.2 The Report Designer toolbar

While saving your report, you may have noticed there are many other options there besides just saving the report. You can find out more about the toolbar buttons on the Report Designer by [[reading this article|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/3.0-Data-sources-tab]]. There are options to save reports, create new reports, print reports, email reports, and navigate to other sections of the reporting application.

5. Click Preview. You will see the fields have been added.
6. I'm interested in the number of orders to each city and the total freight spent shipping the orders. To see this information we need to add some functions to the fields.
7. Next to the **OrderID** field select **count** from the function drop down box. This will count the number of order IDs from the previous report. Let's change the description to **Orders** by entering that into the description textbox.
8. **Notice that when a function is selected all of the fields default to using the group function.
9. Next to the **Freight** field select **sum** from the function drop down box. This will sum the freight. Let's change the description to **Freight** by entering that into the description textbox.

2.3.5 Exporting a Report

_**Goal**_ - The goal of this lesson is to:

* Export the report to Excel

_**Note:** To retain this information as it shows on your current Izenda Report let's export the information to Excel. Remember to capture the information showing on a current Izenda report you must download the report. Otherwise the report can change each time you open the report since it reads the data in real time from your data base._

1. If you do not have the lesson open from before, then you will need to load it by clicking the link above. 
2. Click on the **Excel** button on the tool bar.
3. You will see a box that asks **Do you want to open or save this file**.
4. Click **Open**.
5. Now you will see a **web** version of the report. If you get a dialog box that states the file could be harmful to your computer, you can ignore it. Izenda reports will never harm your computer.
6. Click file, save as.
7. Decide where you want to save the file and name the file.
8. Change the **Save as type** to Microsoft Excel Worksheet.
9. You now have an Excel document that shows the information from your report.
