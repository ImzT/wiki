#4.0 Fields Tab

[[_TOC_]]

##About

The Fields tab is where the actual report is built. This tab allows you to define which fields from your Data Source that will be included in your report and any grouping, sorting, and totaling that needs to be performed. There are a multitude of options that are available to users from this tab. Listed below is a brief description of the properties available on the Fields tab.

##4.1 Field Dropdown Menu

The **Field** dropdown menu is a list of the available fields in the table(s)/view(s) that are selected on the **Data Sources** tab. When working with multiple tables/views, the fields are categorized according to which Data Source they come from. The entries in the list that are in **Bold** are the table/datasource names. If the [[ShowDatabaseTypes|/API/CodeSamples/ShowDatabaseTypes]] setting is enabled, you could also see the data type next to the field name.

##4.2 Description

Automatically inputs the name of the associated Field that you selected. You have the option to change the description and it will appear as the new title when displayed. You can decide how wide the control is with the [[DescriptionWidth|/API/CodeSamples/DescriptionWidth]] property.

##4.3 Sort, VG, & Arithmetic Check Boxes 

The following table explains the Sort, Group, and VG Check Box features.

|**Features**|**Description**|
|:----------:|:-------------:|
|Sort check box|Check this box if you want the table/view to be sorted in ascending order by the field selected in the Field dropdown menu to the left. You can also sort in descending order in the [[advanced properties|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/4.0-fields-tab#4.8-Advanced-Field-Settings-Button]].|
|VG check box|When checked, this option will cause the field that it is checked for to be separated into subheadings. This can better allow report viewers to easily see related data. Visual group behavior is controlled by the [[style tab|/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab]].
|Arithmetic|Arithmetic.  Performs basic calculations (+, -, x, %) and concatenation of text.|

##4.4 Other Buttons on the Fields Tab

The ![](/Guides/ReportDesign/5.0-Filters-tab/filter_delete.png), ![](/Guides/ReportDesign/5.0-Filters-tab/filter_create_below.png), and ![](/Guides/ReportDesign/5.0-Filters-tab/filter_create_above.png) buttons apply to the row that they are displayed in and allow you the flexibility to re-organize your data without creating a whole new report.

Below is a table that describes the function buttons of the Fields tab.

|**Icon**|**Control Name**|**Description**|

##4.5 Functions Drop-Down

Functions allow you to perform calculations on the data and can be chosen from the dropdown menu based on the data type of the selected Field. Here is an [[article on SQL Functions|http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_functions.asp]]

*Note*: When calculating a field containing an expression, you must use a function aggregate if you want to use a calculated field in a chart. Click [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/FAQ/Calculated-Field-With-Expression-In-Chart) for more details.

##4.6 Format Dropdown Menu

The **Format** dropdown menu is a list of formats for the entries of the field selected in the **Field** dropdown menu directly to the left to appear in.  Depending on the Field data type and the function, you will have differing options for formatting.  The main two formats used will be available for all numbers and dates.  

**Numeric Formats Available**

|**Format**|**Description**|**Examples**|
|:--------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
|. . .|Displays the number as it is stored in the database|500|
|0,000|Displays as a whole number|500 |
|0,000.00|Displays with two decimal places|$500.00|
|$0.00|Displays as currency with two decimal places|$500.00|
|$/100|Displays the Number / 100 In currency format.|$5.00|
|0.0|Displays with one decimal place|500.0|
|0.00|Displays with two decimal places|500.00|
|0.000|Displays with three decimal places|500.000|
|0%|Displays the number as a percentage|50000%|
|% of Group (with rounding)|Same as % of Group but rounds to closest tenth (ex. 1.11547% would be 1.1%).|100.0% (only one selected value, 500)|
|% of Group|Calculates the percentage of the row value to the entire group of values.|100%|
|Gauge|Shows value in a Linear Gauge instead of a numerical value. This value is fixed between 0 and 1, similar to the percentage formatter.||
|Gauge (variable)|Shows values in a Linear Gauge which changes range based on subsequent values. The formatted field supplies the value to be gauged, the next two numerical fields establish (respectively) the lower and upper boundaries of the gauge. This gauge only operates in a range based on significant digits, so 0 to 100, 10 to 10,000, 100 to 10,000, etc.||
|Dash Gauge|Shows values in a Radial Gauge style with a range based on the higher number of significant digits - so a value of 1,043 will produce a range from 0-10,000, a value of 10,430 will produce a range of 0 to 100,000, etc.||

**Date/Time Formats Available**

|**Format**|**Description**|**Examples**|
|:--------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
|. . . |Displays the date as it exists in the database|7/4/2012 12:00:00 AM|

##4.9 Add Pivot
Add Pivot lets you generate a pivot attached to the right side of the tabular report.  This pivot is always on the right side of the fields tab – nothing is further to the right of the pivot. You may add one and only one pivot on the fields tab, meaning that you may have one and only one pivot per report.

The first thing you must do is select the pivot columns. Values in this field will be used to generate the main columns in your pivot. You can thing of this as rotating an entire field 90 degrees, from vertical to horizontal.

Left: Unpivoted tabular data by country by year. Right: Data by country, pivoted by year

You must then select at least one column to calculate cell values. These are the values which will be displayed inside of the pivot. You may select more than one column to calculate cell values – each of these will be an independent sub-column generated for each value of your pivot column header.

While you may only have one pivot, you can graphically break this pivot up by using visual groups. This will also impact the calculation of sub and side totals.
