#4.0 Fields Tab

[[_TOC_]]

##About

The Fields tab is where the actual report is built. This tab allows you to define which fields from your Data Source that will be included in your report and any grouping, sorting, and totaling that needs to be performed. There are a multitude of options that are available to users from this tab. Listed below is a brief description of the properties available on the Fields tab.

##4.1 Field Dropdown Menu

The **Field** dropdown menu is a list of the available fields in the table(s)/view(s) that are selected on the **Data Sources** tab. When working with multiple tables/views, the fields are categorized according to which Data Source they come from. The entries in the list that are in **Bold** are the table/datasource names. Next to each field, you may also see the [[data type||/API/CodeSamples/ShowDatabaseTypes]], as shown below.

![](/Guides/ReportDesign/4.0-fields-tab/field_dropdown.png)

##4.2 Description

Automatically inputs the name of the associated Field that you selected. You have the option to change the description and it will appear as the new title when displayed. You can decide how wide the control is with the [[DescriptionWidth|/API/CodeSamples/DescriptionWidth]] property.

##4.3 Sort, VG, & Arithmetic Check Boxes 

The following table explains the Sort, Group, and VG Check Box features.

|**Features**|**Description**|
|:----------:|:-------------:|
|Sort check box|Check this box if you want the table/view to be sorted in ascending order by the field selected in the Field dropdown menu to the left. You can also sort in descending order in the [[advanced properties|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/4.0-fields-tab#4.8-Advanced-Field-Settings-Button]].|
|VG check box|When checked, this option will cause the field that it is checked for to be separated into subheadings. This can better allow report viewers to easily see related data. See more about [[visual groups|]].|
|Arithmetic|Arithmetic.  Performs basic calculations (+, -, x, %) and concatenation of text. More about [[Calculated Fields|/FAQ/Questions/Using Calculated Fields]]|

##4.4 Other Buttons on the Fields Tab

![](/Guides/ReportDesign/4.0-fields-tab/advanced_settings_panel.png)

|**Setting Name**|**Description**|
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|Hide this field|Hides the field from display when report the is ran. Useful for using expressions on multiple fields but when only one of the fields should be displayed.|
|Sort (z-a)|Sorts in descending order|
|Italic|Sets whether the column is shown in italics|

|Value Justication|Sets the Value of the field to the left, right, or middle of the row|

The list contains only reports that have a [[drill-down key|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/9.0-Misc-Tab#9.2.2-Setting-the-drill-down-key]] set for them.<br>_**Note:** The "Automatic" option will attempt to choose a sub-report by matching the drill-down key to the selected field and cannot discern between two sub-reports that use the same drill-down key._|
|Drill-Down Style|**Link** – opens in same browser window <br>**Link (New Window)** – opens in new browser window<br>**Embedded** – embeds the drill-down results into the main report<br>**Popup** – opens the results on a pop-up screen<br>**Hover** - Shows the sub-report when you hover the mouse over the item that the sub-report is linked to|
|Url|Allows you to define a custom Url to redirect to when the sub-report is accessed.<br>**ComboKey** - Used in combination with one of the above. When this setting is chosen for the second drilldown key, the value of both fields will be passed from the main report to the sub-report. |
|SubTotal Function|Sets a customized function for subtotals displayed with this field. The default value is "Sum". This only applies to the bottom sub-totals and not the side sub-totals.|
|Gradient Cells Shading|Sets whether cells will use a gradient or solid colors for shading. The larger the value in the cell is, the darker the shading will become.|
|Text Highlight|Highlights the text for a given range. You can refer to the [[Styles tab|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/10.0-Style-tab]] for a list of valid colors. Example: "5 to 6:Blue;7 to 10:Red".|
|Cell Highlight|Highlights the entire cell for a given range. This follows the same rules as text highlight.|
|Value Ranges|Lets you set text values for number ranges. (i.e. setting this to 0 to 10:Under will display the text "Under" when it encounters a value between 0 and 10 for that column).|
|Expression|Allows you to define a customized mathematical or SQL expression to show as the value for the column cells. See more about [[Expressions|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/15.0-Expressions-in-Izenda]]|

##4.9 Add Pivot

The Add Pivot button allows you to generate analytical data grids and essentially adds extra columns to the right side of the report. These extra columns are based on the logical grouping function that you can define in your pivot. (e.g. pivoting a money column with a Group (Year) function will display each year's total for as many years as exist in your dataset.
