##5.1 Filter Field Dropdown Menu

The Filter Field dropdown menu is a list of the available fields in the table/view that have been selected or created in the [[Data Sources tab|FAQ/UserGuides/3.0 Data Sources Tab]]. Simply select the field you want to filter on from the dropdown menu. If you are joining tables/views, the title of the table/view that the field is from appears in parentheses next to the name of the field. The figure below demonstrates what the filter field dropdown looks like with joined tables.

##5.4 Blank and Param Checkboxes

![Blank and Param Checkboxes]()

The "Blank" and "Param" checkboxes (see image above) allow you to control the filtering behavior in the report viewer.  They do not affect the “Preview” tab of the report designer.

**Blank Checkbox:** To use this, first set a “Filter Field” and then set an “Operator”. A value can be entered, but it is not required.
If “Blank” is checked, the filter will return data that matches the “Value(s)” dropdown/textbox and also data that has a blank/null value in that field.

In the example above, if “Blank” is checked and then viewed in the report viewer, then the user would see all of the data where the “ShipCity” begins with “s”, are blank, or are null.

**Param Checkbox:**  To use this, first set a “Filter Field”, set an “Operator”, and then set “Value(s)”, as in the previous example.  This will display the filtered report in the report viewer and allow the user to change the filter value.  If it is not checked, then the filter will not be visible to the end-user and the end-user will not be able to change the filter.

In the example above, a user will be able to change the “s” to a “t” and update the report if desired.
