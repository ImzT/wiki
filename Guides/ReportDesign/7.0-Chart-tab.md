[[_TOC_]]

In the Chart tab, a chart can be created using the data in the table/view selected on the Data Sources tab.

![Chart Tab](/Guides/ReportDesign/7.0-Chart-tab/charts_tab.png)

The Charts Tab lets you create different variations of charts, including: 

* [[Trend|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/7.0-Chart-tab#7.2-Trend-Selection]]
* [[Pie|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/7.0-Chart-tab#7.3-Pie-Selection]]
* [[Plot|http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/7.0-Chart-tab#7.4-Plot-Selection]]
* Bar
* Funnel   

You can have multiple charts in one report or put multiple charts of summary information on a Dashboard to show key business metrics.
