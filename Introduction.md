**Introduction**

We are continually developing online Izenda Reports training materials focused on the needs of novice users. The materials will include a basic overview of building reports which utilize bar, pie, and trend charts as well as some advanced topics. These materials include both video and printable formats.

All training materials are available on the Izenda Reports site at no charge. The presentations and lessons assume the availability of a working copy of Izenda Reports connected to a database containing both text and numerical data. You may print and re-distribute these materials to any users within the organization or company that licenses Izenda Reports. 

The training walks through the features available in the various tabs of Izenda Reports in order to familiarize the users with the options available: 
* **Datasources tab:**
    Here you can select the data sources (tables and views) to use in your report.  There are two ways to view this.
    * Basic: The basic view of the data sources tab will let you choose from a list of recent data sources or choose one data source from a list.
    * Advanced: This view will let you choose any number of data sources and define their relationships. This acts as an SQL join would.
* **Field tab:**
    Here you can select how many records to display, as well as define which data you wish to be included in your report. Here is a list of controls and their descriptions.
    * Records: Defines the maximum amount of results to display.
    * Field: Allows selection of the table columns from the data set(s) chosen in the previous tab.
    * Description: A name for the data column. This is filled in with the column name by default.
    * Sort: Allows sorting of the data in ascending order when the report is generated
    * VG: With this selected, a grid will be created for each unique value in the chosen field when the report is generated
    * A: Allows arithmetic operations to be performed
