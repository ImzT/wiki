If your Excel exports are being rejected as 'corrupt' this is the behavior of a Microsoft security upgrade in newer versions of Office.

_**Go to File > Options**_

**Go to Trust center and Trust center settings (over the right window)**

Now Select **'Protected View'** from the left pane and uncheck the desired security settings.


> This example is in Word 2010, you must manually uncheck the options from â€˜Excel 2010, PowerPoint 2010, 
> Outlook 2010, etc. respectively.
