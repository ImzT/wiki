#Enabling CSS in PDFs & PDF Exports

PDFs generated by our legacy **ITextSharp** PDF generator do not support CSS and many other things such as 'Landscape' printing. 

You should use our new **HTML2PDF** generator if you want to get proper output.

How to set in _Global.asax_:

``AdHocSettings.PrintMode = PrintMode.Html2PdfAndHtml;``
